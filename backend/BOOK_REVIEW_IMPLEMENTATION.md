# Book Rating and Review Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive book rating and review feature for the Library Management System backend. This feature allows users to rate books on a 1-5 scale and provide written reviews.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸ“Š Core Functionality
- **Book Rating**: 1-5 star rating system with validation
- **Book Reviews**: Optional text reviews up to 1000 characters
- **One Review Per User**: Users can only review each book once
- **Review Management**: Users can create, update, and delete their own reviews
- **Review Statistics**: Calculate average ratings and rating distributions

### ðŸ”’ Security & Validation
- **Authentication Required**: Uses the existing `CurrentUser` utility for authentication
- **Authorization**: Users can only modify their own reviews
- **Input Validation**: Rating range validation (1-5) and review length limits
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraint ensures one review per user per book

### ðŸ“ˆ Analytics & Insights
- **Average Rating Calculation**: Real-time calculation of book ratings
- **Rating Distribution**: Count of reviews by star rating (1-5 stars)
- **Review Summary**: Comprehensive statistics for each book
- **Pagination Support**: Efficient handling of large review datasets

```

### Convenience Endpoints (via Books)
```
GET    /api/books/{id}/reviews              - Get book reviews
GET    /api/books/{id}/reviews/summary      - Get book review summary
```

## Database Schema

### New Table: `book_reviews`
```sql
CREATE TABLE book_reviews (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    book_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    review TEXT(1000),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE KEY uk_book_reviews_user_book (user_id, book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Create a Review
```json
POST /api/book-reviews
{
    "bookId": 1,
    "rating": 5,
    "review": "Excellent book! Highly recommended."
}
```

### Update a Review
```json
PUT /api/book-reviews/1
{
    "rating": 4,
    "review": "Good book, but could be better."
}
```

### Get Review Summary
```json
GET /api/book-reviews/book/1/summary

Response:
{
    "bookId": 1,
    "bookTitle": "Sample Book",
    "averageRating": 4.2,
    "totalReviews": 15,
    "fiveStarCount": 8,
    "fourStarCount": 4,
    "threeStarCount": 2,
    "twoStarCount": 1,
    "oneStarCount": 0
}
```

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 7 comprehensive test cases covering all service methods
- **Coverage**: Tests include success scenarios, error cases, and edge cases
- **Validation**: All tests pass with 100% success rate
- **Mocking**: Proper isolation using Mockito for dependencies

## Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing Spring Security setup
- **Current User**: Uses the existing `CurrentUser` utility for user context
- **Exception Handling**: Leverages the global exception handler
- **Database**: Uses existing JPA/Hibernate configuration
- **Validation**: Uses standard Bean Validation annotations

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. **Email Notifications**: Notify authors/publishers of new reviews
2. **Review Moderation**: Admin approval workflow for reviews
3. **Review Helpfulness**: Allow users to vote on review helpfulness
4. **Review Analytics**: Advanced analytics dashboard for librarians
5. **Bulk Import**: Import reviews from external sources
6. **Review Search**: Full-text search within review content

## Conclusion
The book rating and review feature is now fully implemented and tested, providing a solid foundation for user engagement and book discovery in the library management system. The implementation follows Spring Boot best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
